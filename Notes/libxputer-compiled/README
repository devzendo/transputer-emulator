                          libxputer.a v0.05
 
libxputer.a is a simple attempt to wrap all transputer architecture
features into C functions.  It is not intended to be compatible with
any other library.  Consider it as an example for gcc-t800.


INSTALLATION

gcc-2.7.2-t800 pl=>8 is required.  It can be found in
ftp://ftp.botik.ru/pub/local/gcc-t800/.

	make
	make install

"make install" puts libxputer.a in /usr/t800/lib and xputer.h in
/usr/t800/include.  If you want the files installed in another
location change the value of variable PREFIX in Makefile.


TODO

 - better interface for process handling (like pthreads or cthreads)
 - make alt() to change timeout parameter (like select() in Linux)
 - semaphore handling is done rather stupid, there is no real emulation
   of T450/T9000 wait and signal instructions
 - write documentation
